             <p>Not to be confused with information science or computer science.</p>
             <p><b>Data science </b>is an interdisciplinary academic field <sup>[1]</sup> that uses statistics, <mark> scientific computing,</mark> <del>scientific methods,</del> processing, scientific visualization, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge from
                 potentially noisy, structured, or unstructured data.[2] <br><br>
         
                 Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences,
                 information technology, and medicine).[3] Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a
                 research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.[4]</p>
             <p>
               <b> <mark> <u>Data science is "a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods"</u></mark></b> to
                 "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.[5] It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields
                 within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge.[6]
                 However, data science is different from computer science and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray
                 imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now
                 data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information
                 technology" and the data deluge.[7][8]
         
                 <strong>A data scientist is a professional who creates programming code and combines it with statistical knowledge to
                 summarize data.[9]</strong>
